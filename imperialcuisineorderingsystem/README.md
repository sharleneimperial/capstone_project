## About Imperial Cuisines

- Here are some fun facts about this family owned restaurant, which I manage(I wish)😂

## The Menu Search Bar
![](https://i.imgur.com/reZ84y3.png)
- One of the nicest features, in which the User(Customer)can search our menu and filter it down by category or keywords. 
- For example, "Chicken" was typed in the menu search bar and 3 results of dishes came up.

## Place An Order Window

- Here the Customer will go through the menu list to select items of their choice.
- Once they have figured out what they want, they will fill out a form at the end. Providing their full name, email address, street address, city, state, and zip code.
- Then hit "Submit".
- They will then receive a notification that their order has been submitted and should recive an email shortly. As shown below⬇️

## The Order Confirmation

- After Order has been submitted by the Customer
- The Order Summary showing what the Customer has ordered with the price and grand total.

## The Login Page
![](https://i.imgur.com/7eF5giv.jpg)
- This is where the Customer would come to login in to access their orders, change their address (if they chose delivery), or to cancel their order.
- For example, to login the Customer would need to provide their Name and Order Id Number.

## Accessing Active Orders Page
![](https://i.imgur.com/IGxOKAx.png)
- Here lists the active orders of the Customers by name and description along with the price.
- Customer can update their delivery address or delete their order.
- When the street address has been updated, it will automatically be entered into the admin system. As you can see, there is a NOTE: to the User that No Further Action is needed as the updated address is already in our system.
- When the order is cancelled, then the Customer will be redirected to the Homepage.

## The Admin Page
![](https://i.imgur.com/P1iE7fy.png)
- Here as an owner of the restaurant or admin of the restaurant has access to all of the Customers orders, order numbers, customers home address and contact infos.
- Admins can delete or updates orders for the Customers.
- Admins can also change the menu and categories, users, groups.

## The Purpose Of This App
- A Delivery/Ordering Systems App. 
- From an Admins view and Customers View.

## Blockers
- Of course, when creating projects using different languages and frameworks is always a challenge but it's a good learning process. Everyday, I'm learning new things as technology is always changing. That is what I enjoy about Computer Science. I had a fun time working on this project!😊

## If I Had More Time To Work On This App, 
- To be able to update the orders of the Customers. For them to choose the quantity of each order at the same time, instead of making seperate orders. 
- I'm sure there are more things I would like to add, it will come to me.😄
